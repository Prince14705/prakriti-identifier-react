# 🌿 Prakriti Identifier (React App)

## 📖 Project Description

The **Prakriti Identifier App** is a React-based web application designed to help users identify their Ayurvedic body type — **Vata**, **Pitta**, or **Kapha** — through a guided multiple-choice questionnaire.  
It evaluates a user’s **physical traits**, **mental tendencies**, and **lifestyle habits** to analyze and determine the dominant **dosha (body constitution)** according to Ayurvedic principles.

Once all questions are answered, the app processes responses to determine the user’s **dominant Prakriti** type.  
It then displays the result along with the user’s selected answers, providing a clear understanding of their Ayurvedic constitution.  
The clean and responsive UI ensures an easy and interactive experience, making the app ideal for beginners exploring Ayurveda or developers learning React fundamentals.
